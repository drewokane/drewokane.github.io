There's several ways you could solve this problem:

1. Have your Engineers write tools in the production language that scientists can use
   for research and prototyping.
2. Let your Scientists write in their language of choice and then have Engineers translate
   to the preferred production language.
3. Have your Engineers and Scientists use the same language for research and production.

Option 2 seems to be the status quo for most tech companies.
