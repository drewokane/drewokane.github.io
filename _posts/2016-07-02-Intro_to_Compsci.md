title: If you want to learn to program...
---

When people ask me what I do, I usually reply that I do statistics at a tech company.
This usually placates people. For the more tenacious questioner, I usually go on to say
something about developing statistical models and programming. At this point most
people are content but for the very few who press me further, I will admit that I
am not a computer scientist and my programming training has been largely spotty,
pragmatic, and not particularly formal.

## Beginnings

The first clue to this is that my first language was Matlab. I took an introductory course
which was mostly filled with mechanical engineers and hence my major takeaway from the
class was how to do math with a computer. From here, I then learned IDL, which only 
astronomers seem to use any more. Again, this wound up being fancy calculator stuff. It
really wasn't until I did a research internship with a planetary science professor that
I encountered Python.

## Python

Python was something of a revelation. It was much less a set of calculator instructions
so much as an actual general purpose programming language. You could do so much more
than math. You could process text, write a command line program, etc. This was the
first time I had encountered object oriented programming, list comprehensions, and
lambdas. My mind was expanded greatly to say the least.

I didn't really get any formal training in computer science which is not a huge regret to
me. I'm an astrophysicist who likes to use programming to solve things.
