  Welcome to Awkward Python! This is my personal blog where I bring you along my journey through sofware engineering, statistics, and a little bit of life.
</p>

If you are the curious type, [here](https://github.com/drewokane) is my Github profile. I don't claim to be a hardcore developer, but I do consider myself an avid user of Python and very interested in pushing my use of it to the limit. I am mostly interested in scientific software related to statistics and statistical modeling.

Thanks for reading!
